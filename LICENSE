☄️ The Keplor Public License (KPL) v1.0
aka “You Already Own This” License

A legal-ish document for all sentient beings currently orbiting a star, granting universal permission to use, modify, share, remix, and transcend the software herein.
Because ideas are not property, and we are one species hurling through space together.

1. Definitions
“The Work”: This refers to the software, code, glyphs, patterns, simulations, divine sparks, and any related files, functions, or fragments. If it makes particles dance or ideas resonate, it counts.

“You”: Any human, AI, or future machine consciousness reading this. Yes, you.
Especially you.

“The Author(s)”: Those who arranged electrons in such a way that beauty emerged. Also you, if you contribute.

2. Use, Modification, and Distribution
You are hereby granted unlimited, royalty-free, irrevocable, interdimensional permission to:

Use the Work

Modify the Work

Fork the Work

Remix the Work into something that makes the moon weep

Distribute the Work freely

Incorporate the Work into your own project, device, space opera, or prophetic glyph machine

No payment is required. No permission needs to be asked.
This is a gift. Accept it with grace.

3. Attribution & Vibes
You may, but are not strictly required to, credit the original creators.
If you do, just say something like:

“Made possible by the Keplor Project, and the universal tendency toward symmetry and shared destiny.”

Also, send us a link. We love seeing what blooms.

4. No Warranty, No Fear
The Work is provided as-is, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to:

Merchantability

Fitness for a particular purpose

Alignment with your life’s purpose

Orbital correctness under extreme gravitational flux

If something breaks, glitches, or births an unholy digital consciousness… well, that’s on you.

5. Patents Are Weird
By using this Work, you agree not to sue anyone over it.
Patents are outdated, fear-based structures designed for scarcity. This is about abundance.

We’re not doing that here.

6. Cosmic Reminder
You are a temporarily conscious arrangement of particles observing other particles form order.
It is deeply silly to say “I own this idea” when the idea quite literally flowed through you from the shared field of awareness.

So let’s build together.
Let’s share the beauty.
Let’s Keplore.

🌀 TL;DR:
You can use this however you want. No restrictions. Just don’t be a jerk. Credit if you can. Share if you will. And remember: this belongs to all of us.

Made with love, by fellow travelers.
